# timer-js
 Sure! Here's a basic example of how to build a timer in JavaScript with a start button and a stop button
 When the start button is clicked, we use setInterval() to run a function that increments the count variable and updates the timer display every second. When the stop button is clicked, we use clearInterval() to stop the timer interval and reset the count and display to zero. You can modify this basic implementation as needed to fit your specific use case.
